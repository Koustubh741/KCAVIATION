Hiring has quietly started again, and not the usual token quotes. I'm talking pilots, cabin crew, ground operation, and even technicians. From what I'm hearing, this is linked to upcoming aircraft deliveries and a few new international routes that haven't been announced yet. HR is pushing referrals hard. If your CV comes through an internal channel, it's moving faster. That's not official, but that's what's happening. Cabin crew interviews are already filling up and grooming standards are back to being very strict. It looks like the airline wants to reposition itself as more premium. Pilots, especially experienced ones, are being faster. Command upgrades, better roasters, clearly a retention move after last year exists. Even ground and ops roles aren't the same anymore. More tech and more automation, fewer basic roles. They're hiring smarter, not just more. If someone is looking to get in, now is the window. Once this goes public, competition will explode. All right, that's all I'm saying off the record.",

And at the same time, Air India is recruiting wide-body pilots for Boeing 787s and A350s while pushing out older contracts under Reconstructing, which many pilots see as indirect firing. And all of this is happening in a highly competitive market, while Emirates continues steady wide-body growth and attracts experienced Indian pilots with tax-free salaries and better rosters, creating a talent drain that forces Indigo and Air India to hire even more aggressively while pilots' unions across both India's careers are raising demand for higher pay. Predictable schedules and reduced fatigue warn that rapid fleet expansion without parallel human investment could lead to protectionism, resignations, and long-term safety risks.",
